<h2> 2D Particle System </h2>
<p> This is a vanilla JS simple particle system with some jquery functionality. However it can appear to be 3D because
of how the particles are drawn (oldest -> newest), so some seem to "wrap behind".</p>
<p> System uses speed and acceleration vectors to compute the behavior of each particle. Fields have modifiable weight (+  weight for 
attraction and - for repulsion). Their force is calculated simply by dividing their weight by the distance squared.</p>
